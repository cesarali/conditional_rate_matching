# __Discrete States Generative Diffusion Model Library__

## __Abstract__

Framework for __training __ that implements generative diffusion models for discrete data.

## __Framework Structure__

For unified training and evaluation and easy implementation of 
new diffusion models we define in our framework two basic concepts,
_Model_ and _Model Trainer_.

__Model__. This concept is implemented as abstract class ``AModel`` in [discrete-diffusion.models]. The UML diagram of the class can be find below.

## __Installation__

In order to set up the necessary environment:

### __Conda Virtual Enviroment__

1. Install [virtualenv] and [virtualenvwrapper].
2. Create conda env for the project:

    ```bash
    conda create -n conditional_rate_matching python=3.10.9
    ```
3. Activate the enviroment

    ```bash
    activate conditional_rate_matching
    ```
4. Install torch enable cuda

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```
   
5. Install the project in edit mode:

    ```bash
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -e .
    ```

6. create data folders in main directory:
    `data`
    `data/raw`
    `data/preprocessed`
    look at project organization below




Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

1. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   # You might also want to run `pre-commit autoupdate`
   ```

   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

2. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:

   ```bash
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```

   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.

Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.
